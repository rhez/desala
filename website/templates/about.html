    <h3>Who is Desala?</h3>
    <p>
      Origin believed to be Polish/Ukrainian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognized for his amusing colorful vocabulary. His English has never improved ever since his inception (first arrival to Tremulous).
    </p>
    <p>
      Infamous for evading bans with the use of seemingly indefinite dynamic IPs. Assumes a new identity through each new alias, pretending to not remember past events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the Tremulous community formed a cult worshipping him as a messiah/mascot. His words truly enlighten us all. May he guide us on his glorious path and lead us to culmination. May his legacy live on to the end of time.
