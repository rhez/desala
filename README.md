      Origin believed to be Polish/Ukrainian.

      Recognized for his amusing colorful vocabulary. His English has never improved ever since his inception (first arrival to Tremulous).

      Infamous for evading bans with the use of seemingly indefinite dynamic IPs. Assumes a new identity through each new alias, pretending to not remember past events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the Tremulous community formed a cult worshipping him as a messiah/mascot. His words truly enlighten us all. May he guide us on his glorious path and lead us to culmination. May his legacy live on to the end of time.
